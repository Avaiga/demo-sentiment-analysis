## What is demo sentiment analysis

Taipy is a low-code Python library for creating Business Applicationsâ€” more information on our [website](https://www.taipy.io).

[Demo sentiment analysis](https://github.com/Avaiga/demo-sentiment-analysis) is the product of the Getting Started for Taipy GUI. The end result is a two-page application that uses a sentiment analysis model to analyze input and entire text.

The first page analyzes the user input, while the second page lets the user choose a file to upload (a text). This text will be analyzed and the sentiments behind it will be displayed.
